<h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
<h2>David Gray</h2>
<h3>For this homework I wanted to determine which areas of land within the triangle area (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel-Hill)
    were located within 1 mile of a fire station. In order to accomplish this, I imported a geojson of all fire stations
    in NC and then used a buffer with a radius of 1-mile for each of the fire stations. I then imported a geojson of Census Urban Areas
    and focused my map on the triangle area. I then used an intersection that intersected the buffer fire stations with
    the urban areas in the triangle. When the map was completed I was able to see which areas had a large concetration
    of fire stations such as Central Raleigh. Other areas to the North and South of Raleigh had places where you
    could potentially live a few miles from the nearest fire station.

    The implications of this analysis and map could be that if you are deciding between places to live in this area 
    you may consider living in an area that is closer to a fire station rather than one that is not close to any.
